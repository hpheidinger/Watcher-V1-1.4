# ---------------------------------------------------
# The 'superfluous_map' file is used to create a 
#    'grep -E "entry1|entry2|entry3|...|entryN"' line
# by the 'mk_superfluous' function in common.bashlib   
#
# Do NOT append comments to lines with entries!
# Take care that there are no trailing spaces.
# Special characters to regex must be quoted
# ---------------------------------------------------
# You may comment as you like in column 1
	# or even indented with spaces and/or tabs
# like shown here
# ---------------------------------------------------
# Note:
# Entry lines are 'extended regular expressions' [ERE]
# So regex operators must be quoted to match as text
# Otherwise they cause syntactical errors and the module
# fails to start.
# Colons and spaces are treated as normal characters
#
# Use './check-super' to check for syntactical errors
