For the WEB module 'WatchWB' a rule file is rather a 'set of rules'

The first line in such a 'rule set' is a line setting a variable
WEB_CLASS: e.g.
	| WEB_CLASS="Bot"
	| ###############################
	|
This WEB_CLASS is honored by the 'injector' and stored in the database record
for a detected bandit.

The rest of the rule file  is just a collection of RULE name, Pattern line and
the 'decision block'

RULE="Name one"
Pattern="simple string"
#----------------------
( ... decision block ... )

RULE="Name two"
Pattern="yet another simple string"
#----------------------
( ... decision block ... )

... and so on ...
