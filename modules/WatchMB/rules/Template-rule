# - Template rule -
# Remove this heading for production
#
# Beginning with revision 1.3 'Pattern' is no longer a REGEX
# but a simple string and the decision block is a 'one-liner'
#
# Take into account, that the leading numbers (3 digits) provide 
# a means to give rules an order, since sometimes the order counts.
# Have _more_specific_ rules BEFORE _more_common_rules_; 
# e.g.:
#
#	Pattern='Anonymous TLS connection established from unknown['
#	Pattern='connection established from unknown['
#	Pattern='connect from unknown['
#
# Give it a '.rule' extension to set it into production
#
# Use 'check-rule' & 'check-all-rules' on new or changed rule files
# before the Watcher service is restarted.

RULE="A rule name here"
Pattern='A pattern to match the log line'
