----------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not provide a rule that is not at least checked for syntactical
errors with the 'check-rule' or check-all-rules tool.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Keep in mind, that if it is syntactically checked
it does NOT mean, that it is logically working well.
You need to check this from the results you get.
See your trace-files in the module path.
	tail -f Watch<XX>.trace
or ...	Trace <XX>	

Move unused/unwanted rules to a DISABLED directory to prevent
these from being loaded 
	mv XXX-blabla.rule DISABLED

... or 'hide' the *.rule extention: i.e.:
	mv XXX-blabla.rule XXX-blabla.rule-disabled
