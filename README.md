# Introduction:
# üõ°Ô∏è Watcher ‚Äì Driving Attackers Mad

**Watcher is not a simple script.**
Watcher is a **program system** and a **complex framework**
It is a modular, fully automated IDS/IPS framework designed to block potential attackers in real-time, at the firewall level, before your services even become aware of them.

## What It Does

Watcher modules continuously monitor service logs (e.g., SSH, web, and mail) in real-time.  
When suspicious behavior is detected, it immediately blocks the source IP via `ipset' ‚Äì protecting the services from wasting CPU on known offenders.

**Its purpose is simple:**  
Let your services do their job ‚Äî not log endless abuse from IP `aa.bb.cc.dd`.

## Key Features

- Real-time log monitoring
- Modular detection engine (per-service filters)
- Immediate firewall blocking (DROP via 'ipset')
- No dependencies: no RPM, no APT, no pip ‚Äì *drop-in, superuser-only*
- Works with syslog/syslog-ng
- Portable, robust ‚Äì designed for Linux server environments

## Installation Philosophy

Watcher is **drop-anywhere software**. It is intentionally kept minimalistic:

```sh
# tar xf Watcher.tar
# cd Watcher
# ./Prep
