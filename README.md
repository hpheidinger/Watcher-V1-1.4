# Introduction:
# üõ°Ô∏è Watcher ‚Äì The brain above your firewall.
## ... driving Attackers Mad

**Watcher is not a simple script.**
Watcher is a **program system** and a **complex framework**
It is a modular, fully automated IDS/IPS framework designed to block potential attackers in real-time, at the firewall level, before your services even become aware of them.

## What It Does

Watcher modules continuously monitor service logs (e.g., SSH, web, and mail) in real-time.  
When suspicious behavior is detected, it immediately blocks the source IP via `ipset' ‚Äì protecting the services from wasting CPU on known offenders.

**Its purpose is simple:**  
Let your services do their job ‚Äî not log endless abuse from IP `aa.bb.cc.dd`.

## Watcher characteristics
Watcher is a reactive event-classification framework and superordinated firewall manager, designed to act as a semantic control layer above conventional filtering systems. It dynamically interprets service events via modular rule sets, assigning behavioral context to each incident, and triggering targeted actions‚Äîbe it injection, escalation, suppression, or request termination.

Unlike traditional tools, Watcher operates with situational awareness:

    - Recognizes patterns in real-time across service layers
    - Applies curated response logic based on threat semantics
    ‚ö° Updates rulesets dynamically without service interruption

It‚Äôs not just a filter. It‚Äôs a strategy engine. 
Watcher doesn‚Äôt wait for threats‚Äîit reads them, classifies them, and acts before they escalate.


## Key Features
- Real-time log monitoring
- Modular detection engine (per-service filters)
- Immediate firewall blocking (DROP via 'ipset')
- No dependencies: no RPM, no APT, no pip ‚Äì *drop-in, superuser-only*
- Works with syslog/syslog-ng
- Portable, robust ‚Äì designed for Linux server environments

## Installation Philosophy

Watcher is **drop-anywhere software**. It is intentionally kept minimalistic:

```sh
# tar xf Watcher.tar
# cd Watcher
# ./Prep
```
